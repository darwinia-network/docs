# PINK Precompile

We recently introduced [PINK Memecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65fd2671054c8374b8b312c7/), a new addition to the Polkadot ecosystem designed to boost community engagement and participation. Launched by Polkadot Web3, this innovative token takes inspiration from Polkadot's RGB color code and has a total supply of 2.3 billion tokens. This move demonstrates Polkadot's commitment to inclusivity and equitable rewards for active contributors and community members.

For users who want to interact with PINK, we provide a dedicated precompile for this purpose. You can use it in the same way you would use an ERC-20 token.
