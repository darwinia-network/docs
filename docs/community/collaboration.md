# Ecosystem Collaboration

Welcome to the Darwinia ecosystem! We're here to help developers build amazing decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with our blockchain. Our ecosystem is filled with tools and resources to make this possible. 

Check out what's already been built on our network at [Darwinia Ecosystem App Site](https://apps.darwinia.network/). We encourage you to join us and start building your own dApps!

## Roadmap

The roadmap for the ecosystem is outlined at [Darwinia Roadmap](https://itering.notion.site/9617e154ec884b07a7cee9a056374e42?v=0c3e4d9f257646c486a32a0425ee3a93). It provides a clear vision for the future of the Darwinia ecosystem and should be consulted by developers looking to join and contribute to this exciting project.

## Community Collaboration

We wholeheartedly believe in the power of collaboration and warmly invite additional decentralized applications to join our rapidly expanding Darwinia ecosystem. To facilitate this, we have launched the Community Developer Incentive Program. This program consists of:

- [**The Immunefi Bounty Program**](https://immunefi.com/bounty/darwinia/) offers rewards for finding potential flaws in our products.
- [**RFP (Request For Proposals)**](https://github.com/darwinia-network/collaboration/issues) provides a selection of potential projects or tasks for members of the ecosystem, allowing them to choose based on their interests and expertise.
- [**Grant Program**](https://github.com/darwinia-network/collaboration/blob/master/grant/README.md) To fund the development of projects and applications that contribute to the Darwinia ecosystem and promote overall network growth, we encourage passionate teams to build innovative cross-chain projects on Darwinia Chain.
- [**Treasury Proposal**](https://github.com/darwinia-network/collaboration/blob/master/treasury/README.md) Your proposal should address a problem, outline a goal, give a detailed account of how you will reach that goal, and include any ongoing maintenance needs. As much as possible, you should itemize the tasks to be completed so fees can be evaluated and milestones can be followed.

By participating in these programs, community developers can play a vital role in shaping the evolution and growth of the Darwinia ecosystem. We look forward to collaborating with talented developers like you to drive innovation and build a thriving community of decentralized applications.
