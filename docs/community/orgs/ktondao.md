# Overview

[KTON](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/darwinia-commitment-token/) is a token that rewards users for locking their [RING](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/darwinia-network/) tokens for a certain period of time. The initial supply of KTON is zero, and it is only minted when users lock their RING tokens. Once acquired, KTON can be used to participate in the Darwinia chain's staking and KtonDAO governance.

On the Darwinia chain, users can choose to lock their RING for up to 36 months during the staking process. As a reward for participating in staking, the system grants users KTON.

!!! warning
    Please note that users cannot unlock their RING during the committed period unless they pay a penalty of the amount of KTON they have received. Therefore, users have the flexibility to choose the lock period and receive KTON in return during the RING staking process.

## Kton Staking

If you stake RING tokens and receive KTON, you can use those KTON to take part in the Darwinia chain's Kton staking mechanism. RingDAO will allocate 20% of its issuance to KtonDAO, which is given to KTON staking participants as an extra reward for their contribution. Participate in [Kton Staking App](https://kton-staking-v2.darwinia.network/).

## KtonDAO

KTON holders can do more than just participate in Kton Staking. They can also join a decentralized governance community, where they can discuss and submit proposals on [KtonDAO Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ktondao). KtonDAO is a community-led initiative, created and driven by KTON holders themselves.
