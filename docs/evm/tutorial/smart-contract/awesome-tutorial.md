In addition to the tutorials provided in the [Ethereum Compatibility](../../ethereum-compatibility/jsonrpc.md) chapter, it is worth noting that most tools commonly used with Ethereum are also compatible with Darwinia networks. This means that there are already numerous resources available that cover the skills typically employed by a blockchain engineer, such as writing, debugging, deploying smart contracts, and interacting with the blockchain.

Given the wide range of existing resources, it would be impractical to provide a comprehensive guide covering all of these topics. Instead, we can recommend a selection of excellent tutorials for further reading and learning. It's important to note that all of these resources are applicable to Darwinia chains.
