The Ethereum Precompile Contracts are a set of built-in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that handle specific cryptographic operations. These contracts are implemented at a low level in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and provide functionalities like elliptic curve cryptography, hash functions, and more. They are commonly used by developers to perform complex cryptographic operations efficiently and securely.

In the Darwinia chains, all of the Ethereum Precompile Contracts are compatible and accessible. This guide won't delve into the technical details, but if you're unfamiliar with these contracts, you can refer to the following resources:
