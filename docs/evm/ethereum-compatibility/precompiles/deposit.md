The [Darwinia staking solution](https://www.notion.so/Darwinia-Staking-6fecd6a66daa44bb828c760f0499ba73?pvs=21) consists of two components, including the staking pallet and the deposit pallet. Each of these pallets has its own precompile functionality, which is specifically designed to facilitate interaction for Ethereum users. In this context, we will focus on the deposit precompile. By leveraging the deposit precompile, Ethereum users can conveniently deposit their assets into the Darwinia network and participate in the staking process.

# Contract Info

## Interface

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The Interface represents the high-level definition of a contract. It defines the functions, events, and modifiers that are part of the contract's public API. Interfaces are used to interact with other contracts or to provide an abstract interface for contract implementations.

## ABI

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The Application Binary Interface (ABI) is a standardized format used to specify the layout and encoding of data and function calls in Ethereum. It defines how data is packed and unpacked when interacting with smart contracts. The ABI includes information such as function names, types of input and output parameters, and the bytecodes used to call functions.
