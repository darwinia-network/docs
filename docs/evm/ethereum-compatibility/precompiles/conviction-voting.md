# ConvictionVoting

The governance structure of Darwinia has been undergoing a transformation, initially modeled after [Polkadot Governance V1](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance) and now advancing towards [Polkadot's OpenGov](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-index) framework. For a detailed comparison between the two governance models, please visit Polkadot OpenGov: [Gov1 vs Polkadot OpenGov](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#gov1-vs-polkadot-opengov). The article provides an in-depth analysis of the distinctions and the rationale behind Darwinia's transition to Polkadot OpenGov. Central to the OpenGov model is the concept of conviction voting, which is implemented via the `pallet-conviction-vote` module in Substrate. This module is critical as it encompasses key governance functions such as proposing votes and retracting them. Furthermore, the ConvictionVoting precompile allows Ethereum users to seamlessly engage with the governance processes of the Darwinia network as part of their daily activities.

# Contract Info

## Interface

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The Interface represents the high-level definition of a contract. It defines the functions, events, and modifiers that are part of the contract's public API. Interfaces are used to interact with other contracts or to provide an abstract interface for contract implementations.

## ABI

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The Application Binary Interface (ABI) is a standardized format used to specify the layout and encoding of data and function calls in Ethereum. It defines how data is packed and unpacked when interacting with smart contracts. The ABI includes information such as function names, types of input and output parameters, and the bytecodes used to call functions.
