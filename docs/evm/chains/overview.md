# Overview

The Darwinia ecosystem consists of four official long-term networks. Here are the key differences between each network:

| Network             | Description |
| --------------------| ------------ |
| [Darwinia Network](../chains/darwinia.md) | This chain serves as a parachain of Polkadot, the main network. It is designed to provide secure and scalable interoperability between different blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem. |
| [Crab Network](../chains/crab.md) | The Crab chain is a canary network, which means it serves as a parachain of Kusama, a sister network to Polkadot. |
| [Pangolin Testnet](../chains/pangolin.md) | This chain is the official testnet for the Darwinia chains. It provides a sandbox environment for developers to test their applications and experiment with different features before deploying them to the Darwinia chains. The Pangolin chain helps ensure the stability and reliability of the Darwinia chain by identifying and resolving any issues or bugs. |
| [Rollup Testnet](../chains/rollup.md) | This rollup is built based on the Op Stack, with Avail DA as the data available layer, and it is used to test the cross-chain protocols based on the latest rollup technology. |

These chain provide developers with different environments for testing, experimentation, and deployment, catering to the specific needs of the Darwinia ecosystem.
