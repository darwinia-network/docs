# Cross Chain Abstract Account

The concept of a cross-chain abstract account entails creating a corresponding account on the target chain for an account on the source chain. This corresponding account is controlled solely by the original address on the source chain. To simplify and improve the user experience in adopting this cross-chain abstract account design, Darwinia has developed xAccount. xAccount is a streamlined version of Darwinia's Msgport cross-chain capabilities, specifically designed to simplify the process for users engaging in cross-chain activities.
