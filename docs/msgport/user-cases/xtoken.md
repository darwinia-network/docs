#XToken

XToken is a cross-chain token issuance and mapping tool. It can be used by issuers on the source/target chains to deploy and construct cross-chain bridge mappings for tokens. Additionally, it serves as a tool for custodian issuers to deploy Custodian DApps, enabling users to cross-chain the mapped tokens supported by that DApp.

Msgport can be utilized by XToken to facilitate cross-chain issuance after the original token has been locked on the source chain, or to carry out cross-chain unlocking after the xToken has been burned on the target chain.
