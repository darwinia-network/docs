# XAccount

XAccount, representing Cross-Chain Abstract Account, embodies a pioneering approach to account abstraction at the cross-chain level. This innovative concept introduces the creation of a counterpart account on the target chain for an existing account on the source chain, which remains under the exclusive control of the original address on the source chain.

The XAccount DApp significantly simplifies and enhances the user experience by adopting this design of cross-chain abstract accounts. As a refined iteration of Msgportâ€™s cross-chain functionalities, XAccount is meticulously crafted to streamline the process for users involved in cross-chain transactions, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

The user interface for the XAccount DApp will be available shortly. In the meantime, you can get a preview of the XAccount design through its [protocol implementation and contracts](https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia-msgport/tree/main/src/xAccount). It is also seamlessly integrated with the [Safe Modules](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules), developed on the most secure abstract account framework.
