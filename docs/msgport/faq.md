# FAQ

## Which networks are currently supported by the Darwinia Msgport?

To find out which networks are currently compatible with the Darwinia Msgport, you can view the list of supported networksÂ **[here](../msgport/networks.md)**. The Darwinia core team is actively working to expand this list and connect additional networks. Keep an eye on updates to stay informed about new integrations.

## What are the network requirements to support Darwinia Msgport?

The primary requirement for a network to support the Darwinia Msgport is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility. This is because the Msgport protocol operates entirely on smart contracts that are built for the EVM environment.

## How is the cross-chain message fee is calculated?

The msgport interfaces operate independently of the specific messaging protocols, each of which determines the cross-chain message fee differently. For details on ORMP's fee calculation, please refer to the [ORMP Fee](../msgport/messaging-protocols/ormp.md#cross-chain-fee).
