# Deposit Precompile

The [Darwinia staking solution](../../stake/staking.md) consists of two components, including the staking pallet and the deposit pallet. Each of these pallets has its own precompile functionality, which is specifically designed to facilitate interaction for Ethereum users. In this context, we will focus on the deposit precompile. By leveraging the deposit precompile, Ethereum users can conveniently deposit their assets into the Darwinia network and participate in the staking process.
