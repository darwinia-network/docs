# Overview

The Darwinia network inherits its EVM compatibility from the Polkadot EVM layer [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier). It keeps up with the latest Ethereum innovations, maintains opcode compatibility, and makes an effort to minimize incompatibility issues for applications developed on the Ethereum chain.

However, there are some key considerations to keep in mind when using the Darwinia network. This chapter serves as an introduction to these important points, and is a valuable resource to refer to when you encounter unexpected issues while developing on Darwinia.
