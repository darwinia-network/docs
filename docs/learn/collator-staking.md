# Overview

!!! note
    The information about the upcoming implementation of Collator Staking DIPs will be updated in this article once those changes are implemented.

Collator staking involves participants locking up their RING tokens to support the networkâ€™s operations and security through a nomination mechanism. In this system, users can participate either as nominators or collators to help the chain's liveness, earning rewards in return.
