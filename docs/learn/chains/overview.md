# Overview

The Darwinia ecosystem consists of four official long-term networks:

|               Chain               |                                                                        Introduction                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| [Darwinia](../chains/darwinia.md) |                                EVM-compatible blockchain using the Substrate framework, featuring cross-chain capabilities.                                 |
|     [Crab](../chains/crab.md)     |                              Canary network for Darwinia, similar to Kusama for Polkadot, designed to expect and handle chaos.                              |
| [Pangolin](../chains/pangolin.md) |                          Primary test network for Darwinia, maintained to rigorously test new features before mainnet deployment.                           |
|   [Rollup](../chains/rollup.md)   | Partnership with AltLayer to develop an advanced Ethereum Op Stack rollup testnet, supported by Avail DA, showcasing cutting-edge blockchain data services. |
