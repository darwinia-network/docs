# FAQ

## What distinguishes the Darwinia, Crab and Pangolin networks from each other?

See [Chains And Explorers](../evm/chains/overview.md) 

## Why is there a Darwinia 2.0?

Great question! Before the [Merge](https://medium.com/darwinianetwork/darwinia-2-0-merge-overview-96af96d668aa), the Darwinia 1.0 era included six networks within the Darwinia Ecosystem: the Darwinia Solo Network, Crab Solo Network, Darwinia Parachain Network, Crab Parachain Network, and two test networks. However, having so many networks caused confusion among users, making it difficult to understand their relationships. To address this, we decided to merge the Darwinia Solo Network into the Darwinia Parachain Network, and the Crab Solo Network into the Crab Parachain Network. This merge not only simplified the network structure but also resolved technical issues such as account system and crypto primitive compatibility with Ethereum. If you have an account in the Darwinia 1.0 network, we have developed a user-friendly application to assist you with migrating your assets to the Darwinia 2.0 network. Be sure to check out our [tutorial](../evm/tutorial/migration/generate-account.md) for more information.

## Where can I buy Darwinia Tokens?

[Darwinia's native token](../ring.md), can be purchased from various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. According to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/darwinia-network/), the top exchanges for trading in Darwinia Network (RING tokens) are currently Huobi, Gate.io, MEXC, Poloniex, and CoinEx. [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/darwinia-network) also lists MEXC, Gate.io, and CoinEx as popular exchanges for trading RING tokens.

Here's an example of how to buy RING tokens:

1. Create an account on any of the exchanges mentioned above, verify
your identity, and set up 2-factor authentication for added security.
2. Deposit funds into your account. This could be in the form of fiat
currency like USD or another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
3. Navigate to the appropriate trading pair (e.g., RING/USD or RING/BTC) and place a buy order.

## I want to apply for a treasury grant. What kind of projects do you prefer? How do you measure a project?

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. Projects funded are broad in scope, but our focus lies on strong technical projects that add value to the ecosystem.

Generally, projects must fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced as part of a grant must be open-source, and it must not depend on any closed-source software for full functionality.
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
- As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.

Additionally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:

- It presents a well-researched or tested concept, for which, ideally, you are able to show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be maintained after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources, or an existing business model.
- Your team has proven experience with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine these for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is rich in technical details and well-defined.
- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

In particular, we require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, written documentation is required for funding. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use your product.

Finally, we take licensing and the right of all teams in and outside the ecosystem to be recognized for their work very seriously. Using others' work with no attribution or indication that this was not your own work as part of a milestone delivery will lead to immediate termination. Please reach out to us before submitting if you have any doubts on how to comply with a specific license and we'll be happy to help.

For more info, please refer to [Developer Incentive Program](../ecosystem.md).

## If I have an application that is running on Darwinia Chain. Can I get a monthly-periodic payment grant?

For continued support, you can apply for new grants for new milestones of your project.
