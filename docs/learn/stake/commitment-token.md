# Commitment Token

Darwinia's staking system introduces the Commitment Token as a distinctive feature. The initial supply of this token is zero, and it is specifically minted when a user participates in the staking system by locking their native tokens for a predetermined period. This serves as a reward for contributing native tokens to enhance the security of the Darwinia chains. Once acquired, the Commitment Token can be utilized to participate in the staking commitment token pool.

Take the Darwinia chain as an example, users have the option to lock their *RING* for a maximum of 36 months during the staking process. As a form of reward for their participation in staking, the system grants users *KTON*. It is crucial to note that users cannot unlock their *RING* during the committed pledge period unless they forfeit triple the amount of *KTON* from their accounts as a penalty. Consequently, during the *RING* staking process, users have the discretion to lock their *RING* for a specific period and receive *KTON* in return. Initially, the supply of *KTON* is zero. *KTON* can also be pledged to gain staking power and participate in PoS mining. Users can opt to stake by pledging their *KTON*. However, if a user chooses to withdraw their staked *KTON*, the corresponding PoS mining process will be suspended, and it will take 14 days for the unbonded *KTON* to become available.
